This directory contains for datasets and their PDS labels which describe the 
detailed optical system transmission, detector spectral response, and overall 
relative spectral response for each of the 4 IRAS passbands. These bands are 
centered on 12, 25, 60, and 100 microns.

FILTER1.TAB	- Band 1, 12 micron bandpass
FILTER2.TAB	- Band 2, 25 micron bandpass
FILTER3.TAB	- Band 3, 60 micron bandpass
FILTER4.TAB	- Band 4, 100 micron bandpass
